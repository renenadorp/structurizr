## Introduction
These pages comprise architecture documenation for the Inergy Data Platform Reference Architecture. 
The purpose is to describe the standard architecture that Inergy will implement for any customer that needs a data platform. 

The architecture is described using the C4 model to model the architecture:
- Software System 
- Containers
- Components 
- Code 

Next, any number of views (diagrams) can be created to communicate the architecture.
